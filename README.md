# AI/ML Foundations and Agentic AI Architecture

This repository documents my structured progression toward becoming an Agentic AI Solutions Architect (AWS-native).

It combines foundational AI/ML understanding with enterprise-oriented agentic system design.

## Strategic Focus

This repository is intentionally aligned with:

- Agentic AI systems on AWS
- Amazon Bedrock Agents
- AgentCore and Strands Agents
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Enterprise architectural tradeoffs

The objective is not to collect notes.

The objective is to design, implement, and document production-aware Agentic AI architectures.

## Architectural Philosophy

Every implementation in this repository considers:

- Training vs Inference boundaries
- IAM isolation and security posture
- Memory persistence strategy
- Observability and monitoring
- Failure modes and mitigation
- Cost and latency modeling
- Scalability patterns

This repository evolves alongside hands-on coursework and architectural exploration.

## Overview

This repository serves as a centralized workspace for:

- **Course Notes** — Organized notes from weekly sessions and prerequisite material
- **Architecture Decisions** — Records of key design and architectural choices (ADRs)
- **Hands-On Work** — Experiments, implementations, and applied projects
- **Documentation** — Supporting docs, references, and guides

## Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

Key design decisions are documented under:

`architectures/adr/`

Each ADR captures:

- Context
- Decision
- Tradeoffs
- Consequences
- Risk mitigation

This ensures architectural clarity and enterprise readiness.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tvprasad/ai-ml-foundation-and-applied-systems.git
cd ai-ml-foundation-and-applied-systems
```

## Long-Term Objective

By the end of this progression, this repository will contain:

- A reference Agentic AI architecture on AWS
- Enterprise-ready system diagrams
- A documented AI Solutions Architect playbook
- Hands-on implementations aligned with architectural decisions

This is an evolving architecture body of work.
